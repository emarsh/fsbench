fsbench is a program to take straightforward file i/o benchmarks from
a user space process to a single file in the file system.  It reports
benchmarks in the form of elapsed times for several individual tests,
for which file sizes, chunk sizes, and random seek counts can be
specified on the command line.  See the file fsbench.c for detailed
description of the benchmarks.

fsbench has only ever been expected to work on Linux.

To compile:

    make

To run:

    sudo nice -n -20 ./fsbench

To run on a particular file system, come up with a name for a new file
on that file system, and:

    ./fsbench -f /path/newfile

fsbench will print out its various settings when run, and how to
change them with command line arguments for future runs.  All
randomness in benchmarks is deterministic with respect to a single
random number seed.

The author actively seeks criticisms, patches, and ports.  For
immediate service, email fsbench at jfm3 dot org.
